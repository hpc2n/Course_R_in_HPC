## Problem 1.
Using the functions sumcol() and colSums() from the Profiling section, obtain a memory profiling summary using Rprof

## Problem 2.
Using the above setup for the large array *bm*, compute the media and standard deviation of each column for a matrix with a size 1e7x3 and using chunks of 1e6.

## Problem 3. 
The following R function uses a cutoff of 0.05 to assing the value **NA** to the vector elements:

```{r}
x <- runif(1e+06)
for (i in 1:length(x)) {
  if (x[i] < 0.05) {
    x[i] <- NA
  }
}
```

below is the vectorized counterpart:

```{r}
x <- runif(1e+06)
x[which(x < 0.05)] <- NA 
```

compare the execution times of both functions using vector sizes of 1e+06, 1e+07, and 1e+08. 

Questions: 
   * which function showed the best performance?
   * would you *always* use that function? why yes/not?
