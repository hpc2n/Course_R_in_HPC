## Problem 1

In the previous module about Profiling we wrote a function for computing the sum of the elements of each column:

```{r eval=FALSE}
sumcol <- function(B) {
  l <- ncol(B)  #obtain the number of columns
  colsm <- rep(0,l) #create a vector to save the sums
  
  for(j in 1:l){  
    s <- 0
    for(i in 1:l){
      s <- s + B[i,j]
    }
    colsm[j] <- s
  }
  return(colsm)
}
```

we also observed that the loops were the most expensive part of the function. Use the vectorized function colSums() which simplifies the heavy loop and monitor the performance of these two functions (sumcol, colSums) with any of the already seen benchmarking tools (rbenchmark, microbenchmark).

## Problem 2.

Create a function which computes the standard deviation of each column of a matrix A of size 10000x3 using for loops. Compare the performance of this function with the counterpart *apply()* function for computing the standard deviation. Finally, compare the performance of these two functions with the colSds() function from the *library(matrixStats)* package.
